Page factory In BDD Cucumber : Important
Page factory is a simple and easier implementation of POM in Selenium
It is Selenium's in-built and optimized Page Object Model
Here also, the objects and tests are separated

We use annotations @FindBy to find the web elements

It uses the method initElements() to initialize the web elements
